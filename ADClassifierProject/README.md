# Brain MRI-based Alzheimer Detection and Classification

The aim is to apply Artificial Intelligence with the help of a few machine learning and deep learning models to help classify the extent of the spread of Alzheimer’s disease in the brain. We use the ADNI dataset, which consists of images of numerous MRI scans of patients with and without the disease.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this work is the ADNI MRI Scans Dataset. The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since its launch over a decade ago, the landmark public-private partnership has significantly contributed to AD research, enabling data sharing between researchers worldwide.
The dataset is accessible through the  Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative website.
